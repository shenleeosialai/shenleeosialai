### Shen Lee


I am obsessed with the architecture of scale,designing backend systems and algorithms that can support millions of concurrent users and process complex, real-world data. My current focus is on platforms that redefine how humans interact with information and with each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp; learning Go, still trying to understand C++  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp; I love Python, JavaScript not that much  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp; always open to collaborate and learn  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;●&nbsp; ooh and a hardcore Linux user 🐧
